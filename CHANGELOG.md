### Technical Details

**Error Boundaries:**
- Catches React component errors
- Logs errors to console (ready for external logging service)
- Provides reset functionality to retry failed operations

**Loading States:**
- Uses Next.js built-in loading.tsx convention
- Skeleton loaders match actual content layout
- Automatic Suspense boundary integration

**Environment Validation:**
- Validates at build time and runtime
- Checks URL format for Supabase URL
- Ensures all required keys are present
- Type-safe access through exported `env` object

**Rate Limiting:**
- In-memory rate limiting (suitable for single-instance deployments)
- IP-based tracking using x-forwarded-for header
- Configurable limits and time windows
- Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes

### Migration Notes

No breaking changes. All improvements are backward compatible.

### Next Steps (High Priority)

1. Add TypeScript types from Supabase
2. Add input validation with Zod schemas
3. Add logging and monitoring
4. Optimize dashboard layout (remove 'use client' from layout)
